The root cause of this issue is a lack of proper oversight and control, which should be addressed immediately. The organization should [create and enforce policies](../Limitations/Company%20Culture.md) that require documents to be updated and rolled over in a timely manner. Furthermore, they should provide [training and support](../Limitations/Lack%20of%20IT%20Training.md) to ensure that everyone understands the importance of proper document management. Finally, they should ensure that all documents are properly labeled and organized, so that they can be easily located and accessed. By taking these steps, CNHi can ensure that their document management system is efficient, effective, and secure.

First idea is a REAL Masterfile. Not a fake one. One master file, styled one certain way and thatâ€™s it. Everyone has to input their information into this ONE key file. Everyone can then access their required data from this one KEY file into their own individual file. The Masterfile will essentially be the data host. Contains the same style, never changed, only added values. Everyone picks from it, makes their data, then returns their data back into the Masterfile.

![Master File Example](../../Images/Master%20File%20Example.png)
1. 1 Gives to Master
  Master gives to 2
2. 2 Gives to Master
Master Gives to 5
3. 5 Gives to Master
Master Gives to 1
4. 1 Gives to Master
Master Gives to 4
5. 4 Gives to Master
Master Gives to 3

Each Individual can thus have their own independent worksheet, their own style, their own everything to make it suitable for them. Everything is fed into the Master Sheet from their worksheets. Everything is retrieved from the Master Sheet for them.

The Master can contain comments, for what the figures are, the questions asked, needed, etc. Figures explained. Why they are needed, what their purpose is. ETC.. GOOGLE DOCS OR WHATEVER.
