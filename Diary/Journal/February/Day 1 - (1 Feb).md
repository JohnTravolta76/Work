Met everyone, given laptop and stuff. Had to waste time on setting up my desk such as the monitor and all. Not really sure why a monitor and such isn't already installed.

Started learning from the billing section. Beata and Terry.

Beata is [New Holland](../../../Notes/Billing/New%20Holland.md). Terry is [Case](../../../Notes/Billing/Case.md). Seeing the old system I can see that that emails slow everything down. Constant [Email Chains](../../Limitations/Email%20Chains.md) for approval of this, approval of that.

Encountered an issue where it was approved, but then post approval a rejection happened. It was already uploaded/submitted. There is no way, from what has been told to me, for them to have been notified of this [post approval](../../Limitations/Post%20Check.md) rejection.

**<u>New SAP system.</u>**

- Problem of discounts not being loaded in time. Leads down to another email chain > upload etc.
- [SAP Problem](../../Limitations/SAP%20Problem.md): Discounts and such applied to model and serial number. If a product is the same, but has two different model numbers, than those discounts donâ€™t autoload. 


**Diary Addition:** Problem is from what I see, [Lack of Backup](../../Limitations/Lack%20of%20Backup.md), too much focus on each individual.
<u>ONLY</u> Terry and Beata.
<u>ONLY</u> two tax men.

I saw [random tiff happen](../../Limitations/Collaboration.md), Billing questioned "why they print" repeatedly. Had to go discuss privately for 15 minutes. 
Made me realise, what if they leave? Who is [backup?](../../Limitations/Lack%20of%20Backup.md) Tax Backups?

<u>Happened</u> to Beata, moved into billings, was told in-house training, trainer quit, meaning [no training](../../Limitations/Efficiency.md), AKA thrusted into role. Good luck.
