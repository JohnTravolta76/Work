Started doing more treasury and as shit was getting more complex I found out.. Ive been pulled from treasury.

I wasnt meant to be there yet and was meant to be doing Accounting stuff. So after a great lesson with Rachelle on an overview of securitizations and the basic understanding of trade flow in the back of this book, it all goes on to the back burner.

Although my realisation of some [people not actually understanding](../../Limitations/Lack%20of%20Knowledge.md) the process was true. Accounts payable may think Dealer/Farmer is being billed... But they are not, its Capital. Thats the trade process.

So what am I doing? Find out next time...
