Put in a request with Global IT to fix SAP HR. [Low priority](../../Limitations/Tech%20Support.md)... :)

Finished off Accounts Payable invoice thingies. Then a meeting occured to set things straight on what it is that I will/should be covering.

I joined the GL team. To begin facilitating my actual learning. Told Yulia what it is that I should be learning and covering.

Helped Melanie solve her problem by identifying the mixup in allocation.

Applied for an ERP account waiting for that.

Hopefully this leads me on the correct path now.
