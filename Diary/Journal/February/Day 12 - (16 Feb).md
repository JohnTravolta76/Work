Started the day off in GL. Right where I am supposed to be.

Started working on a task in Bruce file finding Currency, Incoterms and Payment types. [I dont know what Exw etc is.. Neither does my current teammate.](../../Limitations/Lack%20of%20Communication.md)

Anyway. Tedious task, spoken and done with Melanie. Have to do it the shithouse long way because [OneDrive](../../Limitations/File%20Management%20System.md). Yay.

Once again, no real file structure, organisation, naming convention. How to find what we need? Maybe a [](../../Improvements/OneDrive%20Improvements.md#Ouija%20Board%7COuija%20Board)?

Another problem as usual. Everyone uses their own templates meaning ["I dont get what yours means"](../../Limitations/Collaboration.md).

Also again "Oh can we just do it how I want?" I tried to increase efficiency, workflow and convenience. Unfortunately, its too [new/different and people arent comfortable](../../Limitations/Afraid%20of%20Change.md) with it.
