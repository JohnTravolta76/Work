So began the task given the previous day but now with new orders. Made it simpler but still tedious.

Got given Supplier Portal Finance access. So eventually with this task will come in handy.

Melanie decided that my help was adequate. Not sure if it was or not, or if shes too polite to say my methods are too different to hers.

My SAP ERP got declined for [](Unintuitive.md#User%20Menus%7Cbeing%20the%20wrong%20type). So redid that to the right type according to what the ticket told me.

Also registered for Blackline. [Cant do anything till I have access.](Efficiency.md)

Jessica tried to give me recon work but was unable to. So Showed me an example of one.

At this point I just worked on my presentation.
