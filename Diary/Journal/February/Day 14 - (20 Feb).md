Got access to Blackline finally, still waiting upon [SAP ERP](Tech%20Support.md). Mary contacts and starts assigning me work from GL.

Finally I am doing GL and Accounting work.

So she explained the general ledger. Showed me how to understand and utilize Blackline. From understanding the interface to postiing reconciliations.

Process fairly straightforward, always provide proofing documents. Finally, although obvious, GL has [naming conventions](Efficiency%20Improvements.md)! This made it so much easier and efficient, as I had assumed through my limitation work for the presentation. 

Had a meeting with [Magnesh](Magnesh.md) about the presentation. Provided me reassurance, semed to love it and gave me valid criticism to include my uni logo and not reveal things before speaking. Also spoke about the holiday, will talk further on at a later date about it.
