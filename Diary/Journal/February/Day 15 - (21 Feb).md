Spent the whole day doing reconciliations. Starting to get the grasp of it. Did around 6-7 reconciliations, 2 being basically nothing.

**Mary** is the best. She is a lifesaver, and without her help and guidance, would have no idea what to do. She allowed continous questioning and never made me feel like I was being a nuisance, and this was truly a positive experience. It made the learning process so much better and engaging, to know I had a good quality teacher.

Ended up finishing all the reconciliations and found it enjoyable, although I am slow and still learning, its very satisfying. It is just difficult to [understand others templates](Collaboration.md), where files are, not because of the [](OneDrive%20Improvements.md#Naming%20Conventions%7Cnaming%20conventions), just learning the convention schema and file categorization.

Then spent the rest of the time finishing the presentation. Finally finished it the day before its due. Very nervous BUT it should be fine. Its a little presentation, just feels awkward talking about myself personally, as well as, in a sense providing limitations which can be perceived as criticisms of individuals.

My medication is making it a bit rough with the insomnia, but at the same time, due to the late nights, I am able to work on things and brainstorm ideas and such.
