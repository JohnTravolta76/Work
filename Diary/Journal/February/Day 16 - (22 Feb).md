Today was spent relaxed. Yulia was away and everyone seemed busy. I decided to spend some time making my notes.

I use Obsidian in order to make it the most collated and efficient. I am also able to cross reference. It allows me to make mind-maps and link everything together. It is very versatile.

Magnesh came by the office in order to see me, and see how I was doing in regards to my presentation. The man is becoming one of my favourite people.

I decided to upload my notes publicly for all to see and be able to monitor my progress, specifically Magnesh, so when he has the time, he can check-up on me and what has been happening on a daily basis.

Later that night I did my presentation. I think it went pretty well, at least I hope it did. Everyone was so warm and welcoming. When you think of upper management, you tend to think of strict "suits". Not at CNH, these are the most personable, and what it feels like, actual human beings. Everyone made me feel so welcomed, valued and like I was meaningful. I got a lot of praise, a lot of advice, and heart-warming comments. Truly wasn't expecting that. The people are CNH are like no other.
