Someone needs to update Navigating InTouch. It is [outdated](../../Limitations/Severely%20out%20of%20Date.md). Makes it more confusing than simplifying it. I think it needs to be a completely separate category, broken up, explaining each thing exactly the same way, obviously updated, because it's very clearly not. This will allow people to look back into this and remind themselves how to do these basic things.

Started the day off with finishing the onboarding modules. So [outdated](../../Limitations/Severely%20out%20of%20Date.md) really needs updating. Check the OneNote for more info on that.

After lunch, started on the rest of the supplier stuff to finish. To [improve efficiency](../../Improvements/Efficiency%20Improvements.md), made a little tool in JScript that can mass lookup the ABN details.

In terms of checking SF & SAP might try a v-lookup or something. I think [excel addins](../../Improvements/Efficiency%20Improvements.md) might really increase the efficiency of repetitive tasks.

Might even make a custom addin for each sector, that is specific to their needs, but can obviously use addins from other sectors.
