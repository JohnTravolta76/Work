Basically the day was spent with Nicole(Treasury). Showed the basic jist of what she does. Explained what treasury was. Management of cashflows for the organisation so the entity has funds to pay whats needed.

OneNote(Add here) more indepth info on this (copy pasted under this).

Basically, the inefficiencies are:
- Lack of [Cross Communication](../../Limitations/Cross-Talking.md) between teams.
- No real understanding why, when, who, what figures are needed.
- File system "[OneDrive](../../Limitations/File%20Management%20System.md)" is utter garbage.
	- No version history
	- No real structure
	- No user history
	- etc
- User [limited access](../../Limitations/Tech%20Support.md) from SAP prevents from independence.
- No [cross checking](../../Limitations/Cross%20Checking.md), error-checking; Nicole checks her own work for errors..

Finished off the suppliers spreadsheet for AP.
