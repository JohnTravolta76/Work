Did more treasury. Got my own practice copies to do. Learnt how to generate reports with the GPR. Did a basic runthrough with AgDNA just to see.

Although didnt get to follow up in the afternoon for the actual difficult one. [Didn't even know where she went](../../Limitations/Lack%20of%20Communication.md).

Finished up on the branch suppliers. Incorporated the xlookup formula so I didnt have to keep swapping sheets.

Also my [Website](../../Improvements/Efficiency%20Improvements.md) was very quick.

Think I might get more work from payables.

Also saw [Magnesh](../../../Magnesh.md), a meeting will be upcoming to discuss things. What do you want to mention? Start thinking.

Quarterly momentum meeting. First time attending. Performance of the company.
