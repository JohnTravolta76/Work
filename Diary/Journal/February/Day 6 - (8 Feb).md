Went into the office [without knowing](../../Limitations/Lack%20of%20Communication.md) it was a WFH day. Stayed till lunch finishing the branch suppliers.

Went home and had to refix some of it as I did it wrong. ([Wasnt properly instructed](../../Limitations/Lack%20of%20Communication.md))

Basically Business Names/Trading names are valid. Had to make sure they also were factored in under the abn entity name column.

Finished it and turned it in.
