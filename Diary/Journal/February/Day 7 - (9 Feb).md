I practiced my treasury stuff. Used the prior day bank statement to fill in the CNHCA DAily Cash Forecast. Its starting to make sense on how to fill it out. Not necessarily understanding the terms/values themselves.

Made an example Prior Day Statement with colour highlighted, and comments.

Nicole then asked me to do the Master CNHIA Daily cashflow in the finance/accounting/treasury.

At first it was confusing because values were misplaced. Eventually figured that out and realised values are received from [](../../Limitations/File%20Management%20System.md#Wrong%20names%7CCNH%20Cashflow%20Actual%20v%20Forecast%202022).

So far training is ridicuous. Ties back into horrible [OneDrive](../../Limitations/File%20Management%20System.md). No clue which files are linked to what, what relies on what. Need a [](../../Improvements/OneDrive%20Improvements.md#Data%20Dictionary%7CData%20Dictionary). On top of the file management overhaul, people need to be taught how to teach/train someone, or have someone dedicated for it.
