Spent the day doing OCR work. Firstly was told to remove all the St Marys Invoices from the NZ area. Simple as just deleting the invoice and moving to the next.

Then time was spent validating invoices. G146-Area. Started with Cummins, finished that. Then moved to Donaldson. Got a start on that but no chance of finishing it before work day.

Means starting Monday we finish Donaldson then finally move to GME.

Treasury starting from Monday updating the cash file. Should be interesting to see how it goes.

Going to kmart to buy a whiteboard scheduler/todo list.
