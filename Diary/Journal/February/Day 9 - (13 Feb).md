Started off the morning learning treasury. I did the cashflow updates and such. Seem to be getting a grasp I think.

Then I continued onto learning the terms so I actually know what is being said. At the back of this book I have started a dictionary and note taking for treasury. (add it)

During this I spoke to Beata I found out that computer updates occur that just break things on a monthly basis due to [head ICT](../../Limitations/Tech%20Support.md) in italy or wherever just pushing updates with no regard to us. James cant even do anything, so unfortunately yeah. My edge updated for no reason. Still broken..

Finally ended the day with accounts payable OCR work. As usual just validating invoices. If a mistake is made, must be fixed in SAP.
