When there is a lack of cross-checking, this can lead to situations where errors go undetected until they cause a failure in the overall system. For example, an employee, completed her work, had no one check/monitor her work, and only found out it was wrong, once it had already progressed down the line.

Using the same files, would help so much. Files never the same, always individual files. No cross checking occurs in the reports, because she proofs it herself. How is she cross checking her own work.. Better integration, or cross checking.
