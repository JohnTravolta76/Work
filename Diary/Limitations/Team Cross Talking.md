Teams cross talking about what they do for which purpose, so they can understand each other and why it's done that way. Why are people using my report for? I only know popularity of it, not why they are using it, or even WHO is using it.

Only found out what the purpose was once an error happened.

Hardly cross team communication, "I need this report." But Why. Communication only feels necessary when they HAVE to communicate.

Donâ€™t even know who posted things sometimes, it's literally anonymous, I just know It's for me.
